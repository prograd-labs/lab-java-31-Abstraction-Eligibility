# lab-java-31-Abstraction-Eligibility

Hope we know Madhu, a BMTC conductor who cleared UPSC mains by studying 5 hours a day. Taking this as motivation there are plenty others who’d like to appear for Service commission exams. Why don’t we contribute an application for them? This is also a way of showing our patriotism. The first step in writing a competitive exams would be to check the eligibility. This application would be check the eligibility for every exam.

# Your role:
* Fork the repo (Fork icon in GitHub and copy the link)
* Clone the repo (In your GitBash, git clone *copied link*
* Work on the Edit files using eclipse.

The common errors you might face while working on the starter code, are:
On opening the code in Eclipse, by default you’d have errors. It is due to system library mismatch. That is instead of your system library, it would detect the system library of the person who has created the started code.
How can you overcome this error?
1. Right click on the project —> Build Path 
2. You’d see errors spotted in the JRE System Library.
3. Click JRE System Library and click Remove.
4. Now that you have removed the JRE System Library, you will have to add your system library.
5. Click Add variable… and click the JRE System Library.
Now you have added your System Library. Check your program, it would be as clean as crystal(without red lines).

# Iteration 1: Left. Right.. Left...
CDS eligibility is what we do here. We will have to worry about age, marital status, tooth, vision and a few more. Hope this is easy.

# Iteration 2: Mission Administration
IAS eligibility is not as complicated as CDS. Check for the attempts, that would work charm

# Iteration 3: Help the Wall Streeters
IBPS eligibility would check just the computer knowledge.
